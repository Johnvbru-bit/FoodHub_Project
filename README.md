With the growing number of restaurants in New York, busy students and professionals are increasingly turning to online food delivery services. FoodHub, a food aggregator, provides a convenient app that connects customers to multiple restaurants, allowing them to order their favorite meals effortlessly.

### Objective:
Analyzing a comprehensive dataset of customer orders to understand restaurant demand better. This analysis aims to enhance the customer experience by answering key business questions posed by the Data Science team.
